        paragraph={`The day following Diwali is traditionally celebrated with the Annakut â€“ literally meaning, a mountain of food. Every year thousands of vegetarian delicacies are offered in devotional gratitude for the past year and to seek blessings for the year ahead.  The Annakut offering includes snacks, sweets, pickles, spicy dishes, salads, fruit drinks and other items devotionally prepared by devotees. We cordially invite you for darshan of the Annakut with family and friends.`}
