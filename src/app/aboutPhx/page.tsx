          About Phoenix Mandir
        </h1>
        <p>
          A Mandir is a sacred Hindu place of worship. It represents the earthly
          home of Bhagwan, where one can visit to quiet the mind and experience
          spirituality. Visitors and devotees come to mandir to offer prayers
          before the murtis, or sacred images, as well as to attend cultural
          classes and religious services known as sabhas. BAPS Swaminarayan
          mandirs serve to both foster and further personal and collective
          worship. Pramukh Swami Maharaj, the spiritual leader and guru to BAPS,
          supports the establishment of mandirs as a means to cultivate peace
          within communities and connect individuals to Bhagwan.{" "}

          Mandirs represent a Vedic tradition of building, maintaining, and
          preserving physical spaces to uphold the philosophy of Hinduism. The
          rituals and traditions celebrated at mandirs connect individuals to
          their families, communities, and to Bhagwan. Mandirs ensure that the
          legacy of Hinduism&apos;s oldest teachings is shared with future
          generations for many years to come.{" "}

          The size of mandirs vary from small, simple shrines to elaborate stone
          edifices. BAPS mandirs are traditionally categorized as either
          &apos;shikharbadhha mandirs&apos; or &apos;hari mandirs&apos;.
          Shikharbadhha mandirs are built largely of stone and signature
          architectural pinnacles whereas hari mandirs are built using modern
          materials such as steel, concrete, cement. Another major distinction
          is that in shikharbadhha mandirs, the aarti is performed five times
          daily, while in hari mandirs, the aarti is performed twice daily. In
          addition to spiritual practice, BAPS mandirs teach the arts, language,
          music, and philosophy that are the roots of Hindu heritage. BAPS
          mandirs also host various charitable efforts for local communities
          throughout the year such as walkathons, health fairs, blood drives,
          and more.
